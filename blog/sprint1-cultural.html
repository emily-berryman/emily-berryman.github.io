    <h1>Identity, Values & Strengths</h1>

    <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values:</h3>
        
    <p>Identifying and interrogating my personal values isn’t something I often do consciously so I approached this exercise by thinking about what’s important to me in terms of what I couldn’t live without. This led me to identify my current core values as community, creativity, learning, open mindedness, playfulness & empathy. </p>
        
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took:</h3>
        
    <p>Most recently I worked as a customer service representative for a large ecommerce company. This involved talking with a really diverse range of people on a daily basis and supporting them with any issues they were encountering. One day I answered the phone and the merchant on the other end immediately asked where I was from. I can’t remember the exact words used but it was clear from the outset that this person was fired up, and demanded to know where I was from in a really interrogative manner. This immediately put me on high alert as I suspected that this question was racist in nature. Rather than telling them my ‘physical location’ or where I was from I attempted to diffuse the situation by responding “I don’t think where I’m from is relevant, please let me know how I can help”. In response to this answer the merchant confirmed my suspicions and launched into a xenophobic tirade stating that before speaking to me further they wanted to make sure I wasn’t muslim or from any predominantly muslim country as they didn’t trust any muslim person to have anything to do with their account, or their money.  </p>
        
    <p>In responding to this disgusting display of islamophobia I knew I had an ethical value based decision to make. On one hand my my job involved helping and speaking with merchants whose values, stores and ideas didn’t necessarily align with mine, but on the other hand I’m also a person who’s strongly against xenophobia and racism and believe it’s important to not condone this behaviour by calling it out. I therefore decided to respond based on my personal values and let the merchant know that I didn’t agree with their statement and that I or the company I worked with would not tolerate any form of racial or religious discrimination. I then issued them a verbal ‘warning’ that I would end the conversation if they continued any of this kind of sentiment. The merchant took my response on board and launched into the issues they were having with their account. After the call I still felt very uneasy with what was said so decided to take it further and ran the call past my manager. Long story short another team  and investigated the kinds of calls we’d received from this merchant. This investigation resulted in the merchant being banned from contacting our live support team and sent a written warning with details of our anti-discrimination and anti-racism policies that they’d need to respect in order to continue using our services. </p>
        
    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:</h3>
        
    <p>As a Pākehā  who grew up in a small semi-rural and majority Pakeha area of Dunedin I’d say my identity and world view has definitely been shaped through the lens of Pakeha culture and white privilege . Growing up within this culture I don’t think I had an awareness of the privileges I had by virtue of belonging to a white majority where whiteness was invisibilizedin part by it’s dominance. Unravelling and looking critically at what it means to belong within Pākehā NZ culture is still something I need to delve into a lot further. In thinking about other ways culture has influenced my values & identity, I’d say growing up within an insular small NZ city small mindedness and ‘tall poppy sentiment’ was definitely an ever-present force. This culture affected my identity growing up as I didn’t see a lot of diversity and for instance until I was 15 didn’t know a single person who identified within the LGBTQIA spectrum. Since then I feel my identity and values has hugely been influence by being part of local (& predominantly queer) music & arts scenes as it’s within these spaces that I feel I can most be myself with integrity and enjoy the open mindedness & questioning that’s ever-present within these cultural spaces. </p>
        
    <h3>Evaluate your strengths & limitations in terms of your learning & career development & identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles:</h3>
        
    <p>After delving deep into this I think my top strengths would be my observant nature, communication skills, adaptability and perseverance. I think these strengths will aid my learning and career development as in virtually any job / group learning environment it’s essential to be able to communicate clearly with a range of people. I also think with the rate at which technology in particular is changing the kinds of jobs people have it’s really important to be able to be adaptable and perseverance, well I think that’s  an important strength in terms of progressing through any kind of task or goal. In terms of limitations I’d say I definitely have strong perfectionist tendencies which can hinder my learning as I can spend a lot longer than necessary on certain tasks which can end up affecting the ‘bigger picture’ and my time management. This perfectionism also means I have a tendency to want to be ‘good at things straight away’ which can also mean I am fearful of trying things I don’t think I’ll be good at. I know this kind of approach is not helpful or realistic, and instead I need to place more value on process and effort. As someone who’s very in touch with their emotions and very much a ‘people person’ I have a tendency to overthink things including small interactions, the tone of messages etc. </p>
        
    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why: </h3>
        
    <p>Awhile ago I was working on a one night only art event with lots of elements and people involved. This event was organised by myself and two other people - one of which was located in the same city as me, while the other person had moved since we’d secured funding for the event and was living overseas. Since we all came up with the initial idea for the event together when we received funding we were all equally invested in seeing it through however tensions arose when the person located overseas had different ideas of how the event should play out than myself & the other person. The main conflict was that I viewed certain ideas as simply not feasible for logistical reasons, and also we only had a short timeframe to pull the event together so collectively making decisions on every aspect of the event was not possible as this would involve having countless Skype meetings & coordinating schedules and timezones with the person overseas. To try and resolve this conflict and work productively together as a team I tried to ensure that all ideas were discussed and given equal consideration and that I was keeping as open a mind as possible as to the final shape of the event. These strategies were partially successful in that the event went amazingly, however also partially unsuccessful as I think the person overseas felt shut out of the decision making process. </p>
        
    <p>In hindsight, if I was to approach this situation again at the very start of the event planning process I would try and have a conversation with everyone involved to discuss how decisions could be made collectively & fairly, and to also allow a chance at that stage for everyone to voice the level of commitment they could give to the event. I think using a strategy to collectively agree upon a way of making decisions before getting to far into the project would have helped as for instance some people find it really hard voicing their opinions in person and would prefer to do so via written communication before any decisions are made. </p>
