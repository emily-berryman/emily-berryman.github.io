    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    
    <p>Currently my long term career goal / reason for doing Dev Academy is because it’s my dream to build a career in which I’m continuously learning and working collaboratively on forward thinking, meaningful projects and I believe I can achieve these things (and more) with a career in web development. I’m also excited by the huge number of possibilities a career in dev can offer and as someone engaged in local DIY arts communities I’d love to be able to contribute dev skills within this area. I’m also excited by how I could apply dev skills and different ways of problem solving to my own creative projects. </p>
    
<h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>

<p>I’d like to develop my self-motivation and discipline while at EDA and increase my self-belief that I’m able to approach any kind of problem with the right mindset and tools. In the past I’ve been guilty of shying away from projects or challenges that I think I “won’t be good at” but I’d like to challenge this kind of fixed mindset while at EDA and instead focus not on being ‘good’ or ‘bad’ but on process and building good habits rather than just relying on motivation to apply effort. </p>

<h3>A description of strengths & weaknesses: </h3>

<p>In terms of strengths I’d say I have strong communications skills, am good at adapting to different kinds of situations and I’m really perseverant.  I also think I’m good at approaching problems creatively and not taking myself or life too seriously! </p>

<p>In terms of weaknesses I’d definitely say my perfectionism - which means I have a tendency to be a bit too thorough, detailed etc and can get a bit tunnel vision when working on a particular project / problem. Another weakness would be my tendency for self-doubt and to overthink things. </p>

<h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h3>

<p>Based on what I’ve outlined above I’m committed to actively challenging my perfectionism and keeping the ‘big picture’ in mind when completing tasks and challenges to ensure I’m moving through the curriculum and covering topics in a sustainable amount of depth and length of time. I’m also therefore committed to doing my best to stick to the time box suggestions as a way of managing my time and am committed to working everyday on content. I’m also committed to staying open minded in my approach and listening and learning from my peers, facilitators and industry/community representative. I also acknowledge that it is my responsibility to manage my time and workload and ask for help if I need it in a timely way. </p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</h3>

<p>My expectation from the DEV facilitation team is that I’m able to check in regularly and receive feedback on my work to date. I’d also like to be provided with feedback on areas of improvement and areas I’m doing well in. </p>
