    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    
    <p>As the Six Seconds, Emotional Intelligence Network puts it emotional intelligence is “being smarter with feelings”. If we think of the definition of general intelligence as “accurately acquiring and effectively using data” then we can understand emotional intelligence further as accurately acquiring emotional data and using this effectively to solve problems - for instance, a problem that EQ could help solve could be how to strengthen team culture & help facilitate people to work well together.  </p>

    <p>Another definition of Emotional Intelligence by Very Well Mind defines EQ as “a person’s ability to perceive, control, evaluate & express emotions” and highlight EQ as being made up of 4 major skills:  </p>
    <p>1. The ability to perceive emotions. </p>
    <p>2. The ability to reason with emotions.</p>
    <p>3. The ability to understand emotions. </p>
    <p>4. The ability to manage emotions. </p>
    
<h3>How is Emotional Intelligence different to IQ? </h3>

<p>While emotional intelligence refers to a person’s ability to perceive, reason, understand & manage emotions, IQ (intelligence quotient) refers to a more traditional understanding of ‘intelligence’ which measures intelligence based on a standardised test that aims to test people’s verbal processing, logical reasoning abilities, mathematical problem solving & working memory, among other things. Most of us spend many thousands of hours learning, practising & applying the kinds of skills and abilities that make up IQ for instance throughout our time at school studying maths, science and writing among other subjects, however we very rarely put the same amount of conscious effort and attention into learning & practising the skills that make up Emotional Intelligence. So while EQ & IQ are two very different forms of intelligence it’s important to not think of them as both being complimentary to each other - for instance, while developing our EQ can help us perceive the feelings of others, our IQ can help us to verbally articulate what these feelings are.  </p>

<h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence important?  </h3>

<p>There are countless reasons developing your Emotional Intelligence is important… as Six Seconds puts it there’s a growing body of evidence which links EQ skills to career success, school success, stress management, leadership influence & general wellbeing. Solving emotional problems is something we use EQ to do all the time but as these kinds of problems often occur in real life and involve lots of changing variables & a lack of clearcut answers this form of intelligence isn’t always the easiest to measure - but is still super important. As Very Well Mind puts it people with a high IQ rating typically have a high level of self-awareness, self-regulation, social skills, empathy & motivation - meaning they often do really well in all kinds of environments.  </p>
