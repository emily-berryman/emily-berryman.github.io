    <h1>Foundation Core Skills Reflection</h1>
    <h2>
        What surprised me the most about learning core:
    </h2>

    <p>
        Although many of the concepts in the core material we covered were familiar to me, I was surprised at how I had previously thought I was quite an emotionally intelligent person, as someone who feels pretty in touch with their emotions, but I came to realise that like anything core skills including emotional intelligence take regular focused, committed & intentional practise and that I wasn't necessairly putting in enough active work to improve my EQ or other core areas.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also think what really resonated with and suprised me is the idea that we spend so much time focusing on improving and developing IQ through traditional forms of education and almost no emphasis is put on the importance of learning EQ and core skills.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </h2>

    <p>
        I’ve learnt that I’m not as emotionally intelligent as I originally thought I was as while I’m very in touch with my emotions I’m not necessarily the best at regulating or controlling them. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Through the core & tech components of foundations I’ve learnt (or maybe just been reminded) that I have a lot more of a fixed mindset than I would like. For instance, my inner critic voice is very strong and I find myself often thinking that I can’t do something or am not good at something if I find it difficult and/or don’t get it straight away. I’m aware that I need to actively work on developing more of a growth mindset, and recognise triggers that take me back into a fixed mindset (such as negative self-talk). 
    </p>

    <p>
        The other thing I’ve learnt is how much clearer my thoughts become through practising meditation and trying to journal each day. I’m definitely keen to keep doing these things throughout bootcamp as I think having self-awareness and being able to articulate and recognise how you’re feeling & thinking is super important. 
    </p>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

    <p> 
        I think practising and developing self-awareness and reflection can be a really helpful tool when learning something new (and in particular programming) as this can help you to more easily identify and take note of your instinctual feelings, thoughts & behaviours that arise when challenged, and then work towards changing any unhelpful behaviours and instead developing behaviours & processed that will better set you up to tackle any problem. Being clear on what your values are can also be really helpful with learning & programming, as having a defined sense of how programming relates to your values and why you’re doing & learning this in particular can be a strong motivator in continuing to persevere when facing difficult challenges. I also think empathy & self-awareness are essential skills for working well with others, which as a programmer is something you’ll likely do all the time. 
    </p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

    <p>
        Perhaps what’s surprised me most is how much sense it makes to develop core EQ related skills while learning anything, and I wish I’d learnt and begun actively practising and working on developing these core skills a lot earlier but am happy I am now.
    </p>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

    <p>
        For me one of the most challenging aspects is developing the discipline needed to actively engage in and practise engaging in aspects of core learning every day. 
    </p>

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>

    <p>
        As even though strong technical skills are an important part of being a good programmer, programming often involves working collaboratively on projects and therefore your ability to work well with others is crucial. Once you’ve got a solid technical foundation and have learnt <em>how</em>to learn and what kind of learning style works best for you, as a programmer you can and will always be learning new material depending on the kinds of problems you’re solving. It’s much harder to teach someone to be a good team player or communicator if they don’t have an awareness or knowledge of the core skills needed to work and learn well both independently and with others. 
    </p>

    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h2>

    <p>
        No, not at all - as mentioned earlier I think core and technical skills go hand in hand. If we were to just practise programming the entire time we wouldn’t necessarily have the self-awareness needed to identify and work on unhelpful thoughts and/or behaviours that arise when facing difficult programming challenges, and might therefore be more likely to ‘give up’ or think we’re not cut out for programming, whereas developing core skills enables us to begin to train our mind to be better equipped to deal with all kinds of problems and difficult emotions.

     <h1>
         Preparing for Bootcamp - Updated Learning Plan
     </h1>

     <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

     <p>
         My long term career goal is to work in a role in which I’m always learning and working collaboratively on projects which aim to make a positive difference and contribution to others in some way. I’m not 100% sure exactly what these projects will look like yet, but ultimately know I want to be engaged in impactful work that aligns with my values.
    </p>

    <p>
         I’m also really excited by the huge number of possibilities a future in dev can offer and would like to also use my programming skills to develop creative projects - both of my own and in collaboration with others.
    </p>

    <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

    <p>
        In Sprint 2 I identified my top strengths as my communication skills, adaptability, perseverance and ability to not take things too seriously. I identified my weaknesses as my perfectionism, and tendency for self-doubt and to overthink things. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Reflecting on whether any of these strengths & limitations have changed throughout foundations, I’d say that I still feel the strengths I initially identified remain true, although I’m not sure that I’d still count being adaptable as a particularly strong strength throughout foundations. While my aim was to be as adaptable as possible I often when I was really struggling to make progress with a challenge this would trigger a strong emotional response which could hinder my ability to methodically work my way through the challenge. While keeping negative emotions in check is definitely still an ongoing process I’ve found that talking with peers experiencing similar feelings, and reminding myself to regularly practise exercise and mindfulness have all helped.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moving forwards to Bootcamp I think my biggest challenge will be to continue to actively work towards more of a growth rather than fixed mindset, and continue to develop tools to work through tasks calmly, without negative emotions & thoughts taking over. I do find it easy to communicate with others, and so far haven’t been too shy about asking for help when I need it so I think that will help going into Bootcamp, but I’d also like to work more on my self-belief and further develop tools to enable me to work through complex tasks independently.
    </p>

    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

    <p>
        I anticipate some of my biggest non-technical challenges during Bootcamp to be keeping on top of new material as I’m aware that the curriculum moves pretty fast and that there will be people in the course that already know a lot more than I know technically, so I’m concerned about not fully understanding material before we move onto the next thing, and not necessarily having enough time to catch up if that’s the case. I think my other main concern is maintaining strong focus for long periods of time, as up until this point I often feel like my brain works at peak focus in the mornings, or at certain times, but definitely lapses in the afternoon or other points of the day, so maintaining focus so I can retain and apply info will be challenging. 
    </p>

    <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
    </h2>

    <p>
        I think I’d like to be better at giving and receiving feedback. In the past if I’ve ever given my peers or work mates feedback it’s often all purely positive in nature, and I find it tricky to give other kinds of feedback for fear of this feedback being received in the wrong way.  I’d also like to challenge myself to be able to receive constructive feedback without  feeling defensive or attacked. I’d also like to develop my self-awareness further both so I’m able to work and learn better by myself and with others.
    </p>

    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
    </h2>

    <p>
        My expectations of myself are that I will improve my discipline and focus, and arrive on time (or early) every morning. As much as possible I’m committed to making time outside of class hours to catch up and ensure I understand where we’re at each day so as to mitigate any risk of feeling or falling behind. I know that with these first two commitments, comes a further commitment to minimise other commitments outside of Bootcamp so I have the time and space to fully focus on Bootcamp. In saying this, I also think taking breaks is important and plan to still catch up with friends. I’m also committed to reaching out to my peers & facilitators when I need help after I’ve already tried a few different ways of approaching and working at a problem myself.
