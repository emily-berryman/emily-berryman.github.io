    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

    <h3> How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
    
    <p>
        Neuroplasticity means that rather than reaching a certain age at which our brain’s become fixed and finish developing (as was previously believed), our brains are incredibly malleable. When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons, and the more that we practise applying our new knowledge the more our neural networks will fuse together and hence we can literally rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances and acquire new skills. One of the main principles of neuroplasticity is that practice makes permanent - every thought or action or skill you practice has a specific set of connections that fire in the brain, but these connections only stay strong if they’re used. Knowing these basic principles of how neuroplasticity can help empower people to realise that their intelligence, thought patterns & skills are not fixed and that it’s entirely possible to learn new things, behaviours and skills by following the principles of neuroplasticity.

    <h3> Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit: </h3>

    <p>
         I know that in the past I’ve had a tendency to avoid learning in areas I find difficult and don’t think I’m naturally good at. Thinking about the principals of neuroplasticity I can see that I’ve strengthened this way of thinking through consistently thinking and acting in a way that’s consistent with these thoughts for a long period of time, so in order to change and challenge thinking in this way I know I need to consistently not shy away from things I think may be difficult, and that the more I learn and practise what I’ve learnt in areas that I don’t feel necessarily come naturally to me (like for instance programming) the weaker my thought process around shying away from difficult things should become as I’ll be able to prove to myself that difficult things are not insurmountable. 
    </p>

    <h3>What are some ways you can increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>

    <p>
        There are heaps of ways to increase your neuroplasticity. At first it can be good to find clarity on what is you’re wanting to achieve and why and from there make goals around how you’re going to do these things. The reason this is important is that you’re much more likely to practise learning a new skill in a new area regularly & consistently if you’re clear on your reason for doing so. Another thing that can help is to create micro-habits out of your goals - as the more you can break goals down into small tasks that you’re able to repeat and expand upon, the more achievable the goal is going to become. Two other things that can help increase your neuroplasticity - are prioritizing practising exercise and mindfulness. Mindfulness in particular helps you increase your self-awareness which in turn help to make better more intentional value based decisions.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

    <h3>What does a Growth Mindset mean and why is this relevant? </h3>

    <p>
        A growth mindset means that people believe that “their talents and abilities can be developed through effort” learning and persistence. Just practising a ‘growth mindset’ doesn’t necessarily mean everyone can be Einstein, but a growth mindset says you can improve your abilities by actively working on things. In contrast inhabiting a fixed mindset means people are likely to believe that their “basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits.” 
    </p>

    <p>
        This info is relevant as during this course (and just throughout life in general) we’ll often be faced with challenging tasks and new information which we’ll be much better equipped to approach with a growth rather than fixed mindset. For instance, approaching a difficult task from a fixed mindset we might immediately think “I’m just not good at this thing, I can’t do it” whereas if we challenge ourself to inhabit a growth mindset in response we might say “I can’t do this thing...yet, but it will get easier the more I practise…” 
    </p>

    <p>
        During my research on growth vs fixed mindsets I think one thing that stuck with me is that it’s not really an either or thing, in that we often inhabit a mixture of both types of mindsets, and it’s virtually impossible to inhabit a growth mindset 100% of the time. Therefore what’s important is recognising what triggers might cause us to switch from a fixed to growth mindset, and then think about strategies we can use to recognise and challenge this shift. Triggers could be things like comparing ourselves with others, receiving criticism, or being self-critical of our progress which could cause us to feel insecure and/or defensive - a response which inhibits growth. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My aim is to integrate more of a growth mindset into my learning journey by practising responding with “not yet” when my inner voice tells me I can’t do something, or am not good at something. I also think keeping a journal and regularly reflecting on the learning process is a good way of developing more self-awareness around my thought patterns & frame of mind. I found this article <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means#:~:text=To%20briefly%20sum%20up%20the,their%20talents%20are%20innate%20gifts)." alt="What having a growth mindset actually means">here</a>  by Carol Dweck particularly useful!
